# Crop Recommendation App üå±

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that helps recommend suitable crops to grow based on soil and environmental conditions. It uses a machine learning model trained on data like **NPK values**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **pH**, and **rainfall**.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- Predict the most suitable crop to grow based on user inputs.
- User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.
- Machine learning model for accurate recommendations.
- Easily deployable for real-world use cases.
